=head1 NAME

repeat - Run the given command repeatedly

=head1 SYNOPSIS

repeat I<COMMAND> [I<ARGS>]

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=over 4

=item REPEAT_TIMES

How many times to repeat the given command.
Default is -1 which means infinite.

=item REPEAT_COUNT

How many times the command has been ran.
It is not a variable repeat(1) itself takes as input,
but passes to I<COMMAND> for its information.

=item REPEAT_UNTIL

Stop repeat(1) if I<COMMAND> exists with this return code.
By default the return code is not checked.

=item REPEAT_DELAY

Sleep interval between invocations.
In seconds, by default.
See sleep(1) for valid parameters, eg. "10m" for 10 minutes.
Default is no delay.

The exceptional value for B<REPEAT_DELAY> is B<enter>,
for which repeat(1) waits until the user presses Enter on the terminal, to repeat the given command.
