# NAME
# 
#  procreg - process regulator
# 
# SYNOPSIS
# 
#  procreg [regulator command and arguments] -- [long-running command and arguments]
#
#  Regulate the CPU time of a process by run/pause it according to any logic 
#  implemented in any other command (it's the regulator command).
# 
# GOAL
# 
#  Run a long-running process in parallel to a short-living "regulator" command.
#  According to the regulator command's exit status, the long-running process
#  will be paused and unpaused. Exit status 0 unpauses the process, non-zero
#  pauses it. Regulator can vary the checking interval.
# 
# EXPLANATION
# 
#  Long-running process started in its own process group. On pause event, a
#  SIGSTOP is sent to the process group, on unpause it gets SIGCONT. No two
#  signals of the same kind (STOP, CONT) are sent consecutively.
#  
#  Regulator command may produce output; if there is output, the last line is
#  interpreted as a number and the command will be called at least those many
#  seconds later next. If there is no output, $PROCREG_INTERVAL sec is delayed,
#  or 0 sec in absence of it.
#  
#  It terminates the long-running process when itself get interrupted or 
#  terminated.
# 
# LIMITATIONS
# 
#  Further process groups created by long-running process will not be regulated.
#
